HOW TO create a template

0. copy original skeri folder (same path) and rename with skeriMontageName

1. run alignToMrcElec(EEGsystem) - e.g. alignToMrcElec('EGI128') 
this function calls readElecLocs.m which needs to include the info abt
the electrode locations for that system. 

2. run makeFwd(EEGsystem) to create the fwd models based on the new
electrode layout

3. makeTemplate(EEGsystem) to load and sum the ROI across participants.
The topographies are only plotted for standard layouts (from FieldTrip)

4. plotTemplates (does it for all the templates that have been saved in the
folder 'templates'
